# SOEN 341 App Project

## Objective

SOEN 341 Winter 2021 challenges students to develop an instagram-like application with creative freedom regarding development and deployment.

## Project Description

Snowflake is a web-based social network platform that enables users to share pictures with their followers and keep up to date on those around them. People can create their own accounts with which they are able to post a picture at any time with an accompanying descriptive caption. Any other user following the account is able to see those pictures, and even comment on them themselves. This could lead to all sorts of interesting discussion! In the case that a user feels uncomfortable with the content of a picture or caption, Snowflake has an integrated Report feature allowing them to voice their concern directly to a dedicated Snowflake platform administrator.
